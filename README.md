# IA Project 1 - Wedding Seating Planner
This project (graded 19/20) was crafted for L.EIC029 course - Artificial Intelligence. It focuses on solving the well-known Wedding Seating Planner problem. For that, we applied various optimization algorithms, each with different parameter configurations. A user-friendly interface has also been included to allow users to experiment with and explore the performance of these algorithms.

## Execution
To get started, you need to install the necessary libraries:
```
pip install -U tqdm
pip install PyQt6
pip install pyqt6-tools
```
Once the libraries are installed, you can run the program with the following command:
```
python3 display.py
```

## Usage

When the program launches, you'll be presented with an interface. To test a specific algorithm, follow these steps:

Choose a file to work with.
Select one of the five available algorithms to run.
Enter the required parameters for the chosen algorithm. If no values are provided, the default settings will be used.

## Results
After running the algorithm, the best solution score found will be displayed. Additionally, a graph will appear, showcasing key performance metrics that help analyze how the algorithm performed.
To test another algorithm, simply close the graph and choose new parameters.
